# Agent Instructions

- Project name is **aLora**; avoid using the legacy "LoRaDM" label in code or docs.
- When adding features, keep the README up to date and clearly state the current project phase.
- Code and comments must remain in English.
- Avoid unnecessary dynamic allocation on the MCU; keep memory and timing behavior deterministic.
